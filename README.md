## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or later

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd nextjs-report-form
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables for email configuration:
```
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.example.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_SECURE=false
EMAIL_USER=your-email@example.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-password

### Building for Production

Build the application for production:
```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

Start the production server:
```bash
npm run start
# or

```

## Email Configuration

The application uses Nodemailer to send emails. You need to configure the email settings in the `.env.local` file:

- `EMAIL_HOST`: SMTP server host (e.g., smtp.gmail.com)
- `EMAIL_PORT`: SMTP server port (usually 587 for TLS or 465 for SSL)
- `EMAIL_SECURE`: Set to 'true' for port 465, 'false' for other ports
- `EMAIL_USER`: Your email username/address
- `EMAIL_PASSWORD`: Your email password or app password
- `EMAIL_FROM`: The sender email address
- `EMAIL_TO`: The recipient email address (where issue reports will be sent)

### Using Gmail

If you're using Gmail, you'll need to:
1. Enable 2-Step Verification for your Google account
2. Create an App Password for the application
3. Use that App Password in the `EMAIL_PASSWORD` field

## Form Fields

The form includes the following fields:
- Name (required)
- Email (required, must be valid email format)
- Issue Title (required, 5-100 characters)
- Description (required, minimum 20 characters)
- Priority (required, dropdown: Low/Medium/High)
- Category (required, dropdown: Bug Report/Feature Request/Improvement/Other)

## Customization

You can customize the form by modifying the `components/ReportIssueForm.js` file. The styling uses a combination of Material UI components and Emotion styled components.
